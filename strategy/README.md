# Strategy Folder Structure

This folder contains the core strategy of the organization.

## Core Files (The Source of Truth)

These 7 files represent the integrated "Playing to Win" choice cascade and strategic inquiry. They are permanent and authoritative.

- **`1-winning-aspiration.md`**: Purpose and definition of winning.
- **`2-where-to-play.md`**: Markets, segments, and channels.
- **`3-how-to-win.md`**: Value proposition and competitive advantage.
- **`4-capabilities.md`**: Required activities and competencies.
- **`5-management-systems.md`**: Structures and measures.
- **`hypotheses.md`**: Key assumptions (What Would Have to Be True).
- **`big-questions.md`**: Fundamental strategic questions guiding inquiry.

## Supporting Files (Extensions)

Occasionally, specific analyses or plans are needed that don't fit neatly into the cascade. These use **UPPERCASE-PREFIX** naming:

- **`ANALYSIS-`**: Deep dives (e.g., `ANALYSIS-competitor-audit.md`)
- **`SCENARIO-`**: Future planning (e.g., `SCENARIO-market-downturn.md`)
- **`PLAN-`**: Implementation details (e.g., `PLAN-q3-rollout.md`)
- **`REVIEW-`**: Periodic snapshots (e.g., `REVIEW-2025-q1.md`)
- **`DEEP-DIVE-`**: Detailed topic exploration.

### Lifecycle
Supporting files are often temporary. As the strategy matures, their key insights should be integrated into the Core Files, and the supporting file moved to `/archive`.
