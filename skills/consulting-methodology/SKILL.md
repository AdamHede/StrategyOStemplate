### Workshop Methods

## How to Extend This Skill

When you develop a reusable framework or method:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this folder
2. Document: What it is, when to use it, how to apply it
3. Include examples where possible
4. Reference it from strategy work via processing notes

---

## Current Frameworks

*None documented yet. Add files to this folder as methods are codified.*
