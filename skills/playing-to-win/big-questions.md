# Big Questions

Fundamental strategic questions that guide inquiry rather than demand immediate answers.

---

## Purpose

Big Questions are the core uncertainties your strategy must resolve. Unlike hypotheses (which are testable), Big Questions require judgment, dialogue, and accumulated insight.

**The AI's role:** Help explore, not conclude.

## Big Questions vs. Hypotheses

| Big Questions | Hypotheses |
|---------------|------------|
| Open-ended strategic questions | Specific testable assumptions |
| "Who should we serve?" | "Enterprise will pay 40% premium for support" |
| Require judgment and choice | Require evidence and testing |
| Guide overall direction | Support specific strategic choices |

**Relationship:** Big Questions generate hypotheses. "Who should we serve?" might generate hypotheses about segment size, willingness to pay, and accessibility.

## Working with Big Questions

### What the AI Should Do

✅ **Decompose** - Break big questions into smaller, investigable questions  
✅ **Ask "what's behind the question?"** - Surface deeper layers of inquiry  
✅ **Track evidence** - Connect materials to relevant Big Questions  
✅ **Alert when ready** - When evidence converges, present it for human decision  

### What the AI Should Never Do

❌ **Don't answer Big Questions directly** - Present evidence and reasoning, not conclusions  
❌ **Don't add Big Questions without approval** - Always propose first  
❌ **Don't resolve them implicitly** - Make assumptions explicit

## The "Question Behind the Question"

Often the stated question isn't the real question:

**Surface:** "Should we expand internationally?"

**Behind it:**
- What would international expansion accomplish that domestic growth can't?
- Are we assuming domestic market is saturated?
- Is this driven by opportunity or competitive pressure?

**Technique:** Ask "Why are we asking this?" to find the more productive framing.

## Adding New Big Questions

### When to Propose

✅ Multiple strategy elements hinge on the same uncertainty  
✅ Discussions keep returning to the same fundamental question  
✅ New materials reveal a more fundamental question  

❌ Don't propose for tactical questions, easily-answered questions, or narrow choices

### How to Propose

```markdown
**Proposed Big Question:** [Question]
**Why this matters:** [Strategic significance]
**Affects:** [Cascade elements]
**Recommendation:** Add as BQ-[#]?
```

**Always wait for approval.**

---

## Alerting When a Big Question May Be Answerable

When evidence converges, alert the human:

```markdown
## Big Question Alert: BQ-[ID]

**The Question:** [Restate]

**Evidence accumulated:**
1. [Source]: [What it shows]
2. [Source]: [What it shows]

**Pattern:** [Your analysis]

**Potential answer:** [What evidence suggests]

**Implications:** [Impact on strategy]

**Question:** Does this resolve BQ-[ID]?
```

## Integration with Strategy

Big Questions map to the cascade:

- **Winning Aspiration:** "What does winning really mean for us?"
- **Where to Play:** "Which segments should we prioritize?"
- **How to Win:** "What's our defensible advantage?"
- **Capabilities:** "What must we be world-class at?"
- **Management Systems:** "What should we measure and reward?"

When processing materials, always ask: "Does this relate to any Big Questions?"

## Example

**Big Question:** "Who experiences the most acute pain that we could solve?"

**Questions behind it:**
- What defines "acute" - intensity, cost, urgency?
- Should we optimize for pain or market size?
- What's our definition of "could solve" - within reach or aspirational?

**AI tracks evidence:** Customer interviews, competitor analysis, market data

**When ready:** "Three sources now suggest segment X has the size, pain, and willingness to pay. Ready to resolve BQ-01?"
