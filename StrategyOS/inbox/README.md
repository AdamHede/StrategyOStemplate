Drop materials here for strategic analysis and integration.

## What to Put Here

Any information relevant to strategy development or refinement:

- **Workshop materials** — Notes, outputs, canvases from strategy sessions
- **Research & analysis** — Market research, competitor analysis, customer interviews
- **Reports** — Internal reports, consultant deliverables, industry reports  
- **Documentation** — Company documents, product specs, org charts
- **News & intelligence** — Articles, announcements, competitive moves
- **Ideas & hypotheses** — Rough notes, questions, half-formed thoughts

## File Formats

**The Agent only accepts TEXT files.**

Accepted formats:
- Markdown (`.md`) - *Preferred*
- Text (`.txt`)
- Code files (if relevant)

### Non-Text Files (PDF, PPTX, Images, etc.)
**Do not drop non-text files directly here.** The agent cannot read them.

Instead:
1.  Use a web-based AI (Claude.ai, ChatGPT) to process the file.
2.  Use the **[Standard Prompt](STANDARD_PROMPT.md)** to ensure the output is formatted correctly for the agent.
3.  Save the AI's output as a new `.md` file in this folder.
4.  (Optional) Store the original source file in `archive/` manually if you need a record, but keep it out of `inbox`.

**Tip:** One topic per file is easier to process than everything in one document.

## Naming Convention

Descriptive names help:
```

workshop-notes-where-to-play.md
customer-interview-enterprise-segment.docx
```

## What Happens Next

1. **Agent detects new materials** during session start
2. **Discussion brief drafted** — What is this? How might it affect strategy?
3. **Collaborative dialogue** — You and the agent discuss implications
4. **Implementation plan** — Formal proposal for changes
5. **Your approval** — Nothing changes without explicit sign-off
6. **Implementation** — Strategy updated, presentations synced
7. **Archival** — Materials moved to `/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/`

## Important Notes

- **Materials here are not yet part of the strategy** — They're inputs to be processed
- **Nothing is deleted** — Everything moves to archive after processing
- **Conflicts will surface** — If materials contradict current strategy, we discuss
- **You drive the process** — The agent proposes; you decide
