## The Integration Test

Ask of each choice:

1. Does it flow logically from the choice above?
2. Does it enable the choices below?
3. If we changed this, would we need to change others?
4. Is it specific enough to guide action and exclude alternatives?

## The Key Question at Each Level

| Level | Core Question |
|-------|---------------|
| Winning Aspiration | What does it mean for us to win? |
| Where to Play | Where can we win? |
| How to Win | How will we win there? |
| Capabilities | What do we need to win that way? |
| Management Systems | How do we build and use those capabilities? |

## Quick Diagnostics

**Signs of weak strategy:**

- Winning aspiration is about financial metrics, not customer value
- Where to play is "everywhere" or undefined
- How to win is generic ("great products," "excellent service")
- Capabilities are a laundry list, not a reinforcing system
- Management systems contradict the stated strategy

**Signs of strong strategy:**

- Clear trade-offs (explicit about what you're NOT doing)
- Choices reinforce each other
- Difficult for competitors to copy the whole system
- Specific enough that you know what to do Monday morning
